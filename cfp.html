<h1>Call for Papers: The 20th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW-XX)</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LAW-XX will be the 20th annual meeting endorsed by the ACL and ELRA Special Interest Group for Annotation (SIGANN).
It will take place in July 2026 at ACL in San Diego, United States of America.
Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods in both statistical and neural natural language processing.
Annotated corpora are also a major supporting source of information for unsupervised methods, multitask learning, and evaluation of both NLP tools and theories about language within and outside of linguistics.
LAW-XX will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, semi-supervised “human in the loop” methods of annotation, crowd-sourcing approaches, and more.
LAW-XX will also provide a forum for annotation researchers to work towards standardization, best practices, and interoperability of annotation information and software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LAW-XX will be hybrid, allowing both in-person and virtual presentations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest to the workshop. We also invite substantiated position papers, in particular with regard to our special theme.
Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop (either in-person or virtually) and will be published in the workshop proceedings.
They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Long/short paper submissions must use <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files">the official ACL style templates</a>.
Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content.
Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content.
References do not count against these limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Limitation and ethical consideration sections are optional and do not count against these limits as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The supplementary material (for data, code etc.) does not count towards the page limit and should not be included in paper, but should be submitted separately using the appropriate field on the submission website.
The appendix also does not count against the page limit but should not include essential details needed to understand/review the paper (appendices can contain details such as hyperparameters, formulas, proofs, and tables that are informative but not critical to the understanding of the paper).
All submissions must be in PDF format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind.
Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authors’ identity&#8212;&#8203;e.g., "We previously showed (Chen et al., 2024) &#8230;&#8203;" should be replaced with citations such as "Chen et al. (2024) previously showed &#8230;&#8203;".
Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (<a href="mailto:lgessler+law@iu.edu">lgessler+law@iu.edu</a>). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address the reviewers' comments.</p>
